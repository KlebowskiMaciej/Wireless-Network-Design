# DESIGNING WIRELESS NETWORKS 
###### PG ETI student project

***Own Goals:***

- Learning Python

***Design Objectives:*** 

- Calculation of the effective length of the mobile terminal antenna
- Calculation of protected electric field strength
- Calculation of equivalent radiated power
- Calculation of power correction
- Calculation of the electric field strength at the range boundary
- Calculation of the difference between the electric field strength at the range edge and the protected electric field strength
- Determination of interfering range
- Analysis of the influence of base station parameters on the electric field strength at the range boundary
- Analysis of the effect of transmitter output power on the useful range and interfering range for the final solution
- Determination of protection zone around base station antenna for final solution
- Determination of electric field strength distribution around the designed transmitter
